Description: Provides analytic and simulation tools to estimate the minimum
    sample size required for achieving a target prediction mean-squared error
    (PMSE) or a specified proportional PMSE reduction (pPMSEr) in linear
    regression models.  Functions implement the criteria of Ma (2023),
    support covariance-matrix handling, and include helpers for root-finding
    and diagnostic plotting.
